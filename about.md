# Hi, I'm Oliver

and this is my personal blog with ramblings of technical nature.

It's not that active and maintained anymore ever since I completed university.
A full time job and life in general do well to keep me busy :-).

The content here proved to be useful to some and shall remain online.
Thank you all for your emails with feedback and questions!

Please visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mologie) for current software projects.

# Website

The site generator used for this blog is [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
The Jekyll theme was forked from [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
