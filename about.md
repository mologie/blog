# Hi, I'm Oliver

and this is my personal blog with ramblings of technical nature.

I'm currently studying for a M.Sc. in Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University
and run a small software development and consulting company named Softwific. In my spare time,
I engage myself at <a href="http://www.fva.rwth-aachen.de/">FVA 1920 e.V.</a>, a glider plane
research and flying club with ties to RWTH Aachen University.

You'll also find me developing various side projects - listed below - and taking existing software
apart for security analysis. Findings of the latter are published on this blog after the deadlines
for responsible disclosure have passed or the bugs are patched.

# On-Going, Personal Projects

* Since 2016: A home automation system built from scratch
* Since 2015: Participation in development of <a href="https://soldat.pl/en/">Soldat</a>, a
  classic side-scrolling 2D shooter game

# Previous, Personal Projects

These are projects of various sizes - from a few lines of code, forks, to whole, full-stack systems.

* 2017: Reverse engineering and fixing the NVIDIA web driver for macOS Sierra compatibility. Result:
  [NVWebDriverLibValFix](https://github.com/mologie/NVWebDriverLibValFix), which resolves a common
  rendering issue and is installed on 5-10K Hackintoshs according to download statistics.
* 2015: [gl3w-mx](https://github.com/mologie/gl3w-mx) is an abstraction layer for loading multiple
  OpenGL drivers in one process; it was created as side-project for a university project.
* 2014: Various <i>tweaks</i> for jailbroken iPhones running iOS 7-9, installed &gt;100K times in total
* 2013-2014: Proprietary anti-cheat system for the 2D side-scrolling shooter Soldat on Windows
* 2013: [curl-asio](https://github.com/mologie/curl-asio) integrates libcurl with Boost.Asio.
  Unfortunately, it is rather outdated now and has issues with the latest libcurl releases.
  This software may get a rewrite for C++14/17 and standalone Asio soon ðŸŽ‰.

# Website

At this time of writing this <i>About</i> page, the blog was just hours old. Things on here may
change! I aim for this blog to receive new content twice a month or whenever interesting things
happen. The content is mostly of technical nature.

The site generator used for this blog is [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
The Jekyll theme was forked from [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
